# SD-Metadata-Extractor
Extract generation info from images, works for both A1111/Forge and (some) ComfyUI types of metadata.

### Note:
Currently adds a widget button to the ComfyUI top menu if installed as a custom_node, though the link isn't working until I figure out how to add a route to the html file...

For now, you can just browse to the web folder and open imginfo.html normally.

### Support:
- Supports PNG, JPEG and WEBP images
- Supports hidden metadata, Alpha, RGB, EXIF UserComment, Make, JSON and JSON-like strings
